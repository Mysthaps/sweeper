Made for **Moonframe**.
# Installation
Custom language packs can only be installed on **PC (Steam)**.
1. Download the latest version of the pack [here](https://github.com/Mysthaps/sweeper/releases/latest). If this is your first time installing, also download the ``config.json`` file. When updating, you only need to download the ``.zip`` file.
2. Navigate to your Steam Library, right-click "**Limbus Company**", select "**Properties**", select "**Installed Files**" and press "**Browse...**" next to "Size of Installation". This will open the installation folder of Limbus Company.
3. In the newly opened folder, open the folder called "**LimbusCompany_Data**". In that folder, create a new folder named "**Lang**" (if you don't have it yet). Open the folder.
4. Move the downloaded files (``sweeper_250530.zip`` or similar, and ``config.json``) to the "**Lang**" folder. Unzip it the ``.zip`` file using WinRAR or 7-Zip by right-clicking the file and selecting "**Extract Here**".
5. Launch **Limbus Company**. Make sure the original language is English by finding the option in the main menu settings. In the bottom-left corner of the title screen, select "**Select Custom Language**", then find and select "**sweeper**" from the drop-down menu. Relaunch **Limbus Company**.
# Known Issues
- Some title text are hardcoded and cannot be modified (E.G.O, Total)
- Some text are stupid to modify automatically and I can't be bothered to fix them (Event currency name, Dante's text, etc.)
- Some extra keywords may appear in skill descriptions (most commonly **Resonate** and **Fear**)
